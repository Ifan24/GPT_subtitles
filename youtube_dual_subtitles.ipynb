            "[172.96s -> 177.70s]  and if we look at severely under-sampled regions, this can happen.\n",
            "[178.14s -> 183.96s]  However, just think about the fact that all this came just one more paper down the line.\n",
            "[184.30s -> 190.26s]  Now, combine this together with this amazing light transport paper that can take photos of\n",
